# JORDI'S WINEHOUSE - Coding challenge

## Setup and running instructions

First, install the dependencies with the command yarn install

Then, run the development server with the command yarn dev

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) or the port you have available with your browser to see the result.

## What is about?

I've created a responsive and interactive dashboard for an e-commerce wine store using React and TypeScript, styled with Tailwind CSS.

I've used Chart.js and react-chartjs-2 render the charts efficiently, and I've also used react-rating-stars-component to display rating stars in the Review component. I used jsPDF library to generate a downloadable report (pdf).

## Future improvments

Refactoring CustomChartToggleButtons would be one of my priorities. It works well, but the code for this component can be improved. I would also focus on enhancing the overall styling to make everything look more polished and smooth, including incorporating animations. Additionally, I'll work on improving the reports layout.
