# JORDI'S WINEHOUSE - Coding challenge

## Setup and running instructions

First install the dependencies with the command yarn install

After, run the development server with the command yarn dev

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) or the port you have available with your browser to see the result.

## What is about?

I've created a responsive and interactive dashboard for an e-comerce ( wine store) using React & Typescript styled with Tailwind CSS.

I've used chart.js & react-chartjs-2 in order to render the charts eficiently & i've also used react-rating-stars-component in order to render ratings stars for the Review component.

## Future improvments

Refactor CustomChartToggleButtons would be one of my priorities. It works pretty well, but the code of this component can be improved.
